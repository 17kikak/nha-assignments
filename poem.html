  <h1>Where the Sidewalk Ends</h1>
  <h3>by Shel Silverstein</h3>
  <p>There is a place where the sidewalk ends</p>
<p>And before the street begins,</p>
<p>And there the sun burns crimson bright,</p>
<p>And there the moon-bird rests from his flight</p>
<p>To cool in the peppermint wind.</p>
<br>
<p>Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black</p>
<p>And the dark street winds and bends.</p>
<p>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow</p>
<p>We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,</p>
<p>And watch where the chalk-white arrows go</p>
<p>To the place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
<br>
<p>Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,</p>
<p>And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,</p>
<p>For the children, they mark, and the children, they know</p>
<p>The place where the sidewalk ends.</p>
