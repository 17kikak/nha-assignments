      <p>I want to create a website for the US Women's Soccer Team that has articles from various resources (news, analysis, etc.) as well as information on specific players, highlights and other videos, and their schedule. I would also write some articles (only for certain things though).</p>
      <p>I want to make this website because I'm a big fan of the USWNT, and I often have to go to a lot of different places to find all of these things. Also, I think I would really enjoy putting my own twist on their style and creating a website with more pages and information than I have done before.</p>
